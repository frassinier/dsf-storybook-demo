# Hero

A large banner, usually appearing as one of the first items on a page; often contains a full-width image.

## Zoning

## Style

## Content

- Use a compelling header that is in-brand and relevant to your most important content/action item.
- Have clear call to action.
- We recommend hero images at least 800px by 600px. A 16:9 aspect ratio works well though more of it can be hidden when the hero section is tall.
- Choose your image wisely.
- Donâ€™t just repeat the site title in the header

## Usage

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Usage"
    args={Stories.Default.args}
    argTypes={Stories.Default.argTypes}
  >
    {Stories.Default.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Usage" />
